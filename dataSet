meeting	The focus of this meeting is to identify key issues we face in being able to physically delivery power to retail load in the areas listed below--what does EPMI need to do to facilitate this?  Have we completed the necessary steps with the Utilities?  Licenses?  What needs to be done to get a transmission agreement in place for designation of a TSA?These existing load figures are based on all customers, actual economics based on utility standard offers will dictate what percentage is economically viable to take physical.  The initial need for CG&E will be getting the transmission agreements in place to be able to designate a TSA (transmission scheduling agent).

meeting	We've had a change of both time and place.
meeting	This meeting is to determine what types of reports will be needed and where the shortcomings are for the existing reporting system.  We would also like to find out what type of security will be needed.-Monica-57227
meeting	The location is EB3269.  Thank you.This is  a new day and time for this meeting.  Thank you and I apologize for any inconvenience.Background:  A request was received by the Gas Tactical group that would have implications on the system you use.  The request was to have the existing warning window appear if the trader enters a date that is before the date of the trade.  Knowing that there are times where trades can be back dated we cannot restrict this but to have the trader see a warning window appear to make them double check their dates (if they are for a previous date) would be beneficial to the requestor.  If they know the date is correct they would have the option to continue with the terms.Often times, due to human error, Book Admins see mistakes made where the trade date is 10/15/01 and the terms are 10/01/01 to 10/31/01.  Because we are in the middle of the month a red flag is being raised with the Book Admins to question this trade.  Often times it is found that it was a mistake.  To date the system will only show a warning window if the trade terms were for 9/01/01 to 9/30/01.Request Review:  Is it possible to allow the existing warning window to display for a date that is before the trade date (even a day before) and not just for a different month?Thank you in advance.Monica Clayx 57227

meeting	Hello Everyone,The reason why I'm calling this meeting is to make sure once for all that none of us spend endless hours chasing down and mapping curves.As it stands now the people in risk management can map curves to OMICRONS but they do not take effect until something is changed in GRMS.So it would seem like the best way is to deal with this is connect the front end to the back so that everytime risk management adds a curve or changes a mapping it should directly impact VaR without having to change something in GRMS.I know we have something on the front end but we need to connect it to the back.I need ideas and a definite solution that will save us all a lot of time..............Please accept this meeting notice.  It will only run for an hour and we will talk to each other on a when needed basis.ThanksBharat
meeting	The meeting will be held in Conference Room 3AC18C3 in the 3 Allen Center.  There are no rooms available in this building.  I will see you all there.MonicaI am Monica Clay, a new Business Analyst in the Gas Tactical group.  One of my first tasks has been to cut down on IT handling of data.We have gone over the process for getting data into the ERMS database and there have been times that IT has move data around after changes or inserts have beeen made.  To prevent this we would like to introduce an addition to the process to keep all data in the Business Unit's hands.  We would like your input on the small change to the process and the pub_postings screen that is used often by many.Please contact me if you have any questions or comments.Thank you in advance,Monicax57227

meeting	Hello everyone.  I've contacted you all because Regulatory Affairs (Becky and I) are attempting to stop sending you so much paper.  Our goal is to still keep you all informed but in a more effective, efficient, and timely manner.  This is where Livelink comes in.  Livelink is a web-based tool that you all will be able to enter from the Govt.Affairs homepage.  In Livelink, there will be the filings, maps, rate increases, etc. that we usually send you via interoffice mail.  In addition, the files from the file room will eventually be added.Livelink is only going to be as successful as what's put into it.  This is where you and your group comes into play.  Becky and I don't want to put "junk" into it.  We want what's relevant to you and your team.  Of course, this is all relative.  What's important to one person and/or group is not going to be high priority to another. We will have a meeting Wednesday, the 17th to meet and discuss what's in livelink and look to you all for your valuable input on what you would like to see that's relevant to your team.  Please reply to the invite and/or send comments.Thanks,Melinda

meeting	I have gotten some information back from the Weather last week but was unable to find a time for all of us to meet.  I wanted to discuss the structure that is in the word document below.  I think this is a structure that is closer to our needs.  Let me know if this time doesn't work for you.Thanks,JD Laura,Could you please get a room for this meeting?Thanks,JD
meeting	Meet Joel downstairs
meeting	I have been talking with Partho from the weather derivative group.  The premium from the first transaction that we discussed a couple weeks ago was prohibitive to doing the deal (ie, a $8.3 million cost for only a $12 million payout).  I wanted to see if we could sit down and talk about this again because the hedge may actually be appropriate, but we may need to further refine our assumptions (how many days we expect to be paid on, what is a realistic temperature, ect.)  in order to get a value that is realistic.  Let me know if this time works for you guys.Laura,Could you please get a room for this meeting.Thanks,JD

meeting	We all need to have a discussion around current California processes for both the business which is being processed for EPMI as well as the Services business we are providing to our customers.I would like to walk through each process tomorrow and make sure that everyone understands their roles.In addition, I feel that everyone needs to understand how to do the other persons job.

meeting	Zimin is the Meeting Organizer:"Power price modeling plays an important part in power option pricing, power plant valuation and outage insurance premium calculation.  Over the years, we have developed different approaches to this problem.  Each approach may have its advantages and limitations.  Choosing a different model becomes a balanced act between robustness and accuracy.On the other hand, Research needs to set a standard for power price modeling.  In the proposed meeting, we need to discuss and make a recommendation on the unified "Research Model for Power Prices".

meeting	We will meet at Phillip's desk to review the TRV freeze request.  Thank you both!  Shirley
meeting	The location is EB3269.  Thank you.This is  a new day and time for this meeting.  Thank you and I apologize for any inconvenience.Background:  A request was received by the Gas Tactical group that would have implications on the system you use.  The request was to have the existing warning window appear if the trader enters a date that is before the date of the trade.  Knowing that there are times where trades can be back dated we cannot restrict this but to have the trader see a warning window appear to make them double check their dates (if they are for a previous date) would be beneficial to the requestor.  If they know the date is correct they would have the option to continue with the terms.Often times, due to human error, Book Admins see mistakes made where the trade date is 10/15/01 and the terms are 10/01/01 to 10/31/01.  Because we are in the middle of the month a red flag is being raised with the Book Admins to question this trade.  Often times it is found that it was a mistake.  To date the system will only show a warning window if the trade terms were for 9/01/01 to 9/30/01.Request Review:  Is it possible to allow the existing warning window to display for a date that is before the trade date (even a day before) and not just for a different month?Thank you in advance.Monica Clayx 57227

meeting	Hello everyone.  I've contacted you all because Regulatory Affairs (Becky and I) are attempting to stop sending you so much paper.  Our goal is to still keep you all informed but in a more effective, efficient, and timely manner.  This is where Livelink comes in.  Livelink is a web-based tool that you all will be able to enter from the Govt.Affairs homepage.  In Livelink, there will be the filings, maps, rate increases, etc. that we usually send you via interoffice mail.  In addition, the files from the file room will eventually be added.Livelink is only going to be as successful as what's put into it.  This is where you and your group comes into play.  Becky and I don't want to put "junk" into it.  We want what's relevant to you and your team.  Of course, this is all relative.  What's important to one person and/or group is not going to be high priority to another. We will have a meeting Wednesday, the 17th to meet and discuss what's in livelink and look to you all for your valuable input on what you would like to see that's relevant to your team.  Please reply to the invite and/or send comments.Thanks,Melinda

Forward this on to anyone else you can think of who'd like to play.We're having a touch football game this Sunday the 2nd at Rice.  The attached map indicates the place where you should park (small white box with X in it) and where the game will take place (larger white box nearby).  Game time is 11AM, and we'll play until whenever everyone gets tired and goes home.Teams will be picked on site.  There are several fields adjacent to one another, so we can play two games simultaneously if we have too many people for one game.  I will bring two footballs, and some cones for field boundaries.  Please feel free to bring other equipment as you see fit (e.g. - footballs, cones, flags, other if you have them).  Cleats are recommended if you own them already (and if not, go pick up a pair at Academy for $20).  Please bring your own water/food/beer/other refreshments. <<Rice U Map for Flag Football.gif>>
